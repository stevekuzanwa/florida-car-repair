                    those that are not. When something feels “off” with your vehicle, don't hesitate to bring it to FLORIDA CAR Repair.

                <p> Many people are of the opinion that when a repair facility tries to sell them extra services, it’s a tactic to separate 
                hard-working. At FLORIDA CAR Repair, this is never the case. We only recommend factory-specified, mileage-based maintenance
                services that are recommended specifically for your vehicle at precise milestones during the life of your car. </p>

                    Factory-specified maintenance includes maintenance procedures recommended by the manufacturer of your vehicle based on
                    certain milestones throughout its life. Many of these procedures are regarding fluids, i.e., Transmission Fluid, 
                    Coolant, Differential Fluid/Gear Oil, Brake Fluid, Power Steering Fluid, and so on.

                <p> Many of us are familiar with the stress and worry of a roadside breakdown, however many common issues with a vehicle can be
                easily found and prevented simply by having it serviced regularly. Bringing your vehicle in for a service is the best way to
                detect and fix potential problems, and will usually wind up cheaper than having to get a fault fixed after a breakdown – prevention is better than a cure! </p>
